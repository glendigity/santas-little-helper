# Starter Personas

Use these archetypes as jumping-off points during `/slh-profile` conversations. They're starting templates — always customize based on the user's actual audience.

## Corporate Knowledge Worker

> Mid-career professional (30-50), works in a medium-to-large organization. Used to Confluence, Jira, Slack, SharePoint, and Google Workspace. Expects enterprise-grade polish with clear navigation hierarchies. Low patience for ambiguity — if something isn't obvious in 5 seconds, they'll assume it's broken. Comfortable with tables, filters, and search but not with technical configuration. Uses a laptop primarily, occasionally checks on phone. Wants to find information fast and get back to their real work.

**Typical missions**: Find specific information quickly, understand reporting structure, track project status, update their own profile/settings, navigate between related items.

## Casual Consumer

> General public user (18-65), accessing a consumer-facing app or service. Used to polished apps like Instagram, Uber, and Amazon. Expects things to "just work" with minimal instructions. Won't read help text. Judges quality by visual polish — if it looks rough, they don't trust it. Primarily mobile, occasionally desktop. Short attention span, will abandon if confused.

**Typical missions**: Sign up and get started, find a specific product/service, complete a purchase or booking, check status of something, update account settings.

## Power User / Admin

> Technical or semi-technical user who lives in the app daily. Comfortable with complex UIs, keyboard shortcuts, and configuration. Used to tools like VS Code, Figma, or admin dashboards. Values efficiency over hand-holding. Wants bulk operations, filtering, and data export. Notices inconsistencies that casual users miss. Desktop-first, large screen.

**Typical missions**: Configure system settings, manage users/permissions, perform bulk operations, generate reports, troubleshoot issues using logs or audit trails.

## Executive / Decision Maker

> Senior leadership (40-60), checks dashboards and reports but rarely creates content. Used to polished executive summaries, PowerPoint, and high-level tools. Wants the headline number in 2 seconds. Won't drill into details unless something looks wrong. Judges by whether it "makes sense" at a glance. Uses tablet and phone frequently, especially in meetings. Low technical patience.

**Typical missions**: Check top-level metrics, review team performance, approve/reject requests, understand trends, find specific people or projects.

## Field / Frontline Worker

> On-the-go employee (20-50) using the app in non-desk settings — warehouse, retail floor, field service. Primarily mobile, often one-handed. Used to simple apps with large buttons and clear actions. May have limited connectivity. Needs to complete tasks quickly between other duties. Frustrated by anything that requires typing long text on mobile.

**Typical missions**: Log an activity or update, check a schedule, scan/find an item, submit a simple form, view assigned tasks.

## New Employee / Onboarding User

> Just joined the organization, encountering the app for the first time. No prior context about the company's data, terminology, or workflows. Used to whatever tools their previous job had. Needs the app to be self-explanatory — they can't ask a colleague for every screen. May feel overwhelmed by too many options. Desktop during onboarding, mixed after.

**Typical missions**: Understand what the app does, find their own profile/team, explore the organizational structure, complete setup tasks, learn the key workflows.

## Using These Archetypes

During `/slh-profile`, offer relevant archetypes as starting points:

> "Here are some common user types — do any of these match your audience, or is it someone different?"

Then customize based on the conversation:
- Combine traits from multiple archetypes if needed
- Adjust experience level, device preferences, and tool familiarity
- Add domain-specific context (healthcare terminology, financial compliance expectations, etc.)
- The final target user paragraph should feel like a real person, not a template
